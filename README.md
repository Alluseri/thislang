## Usage
If you launch with no arguments, you will be prompted to enter the code you want to execute.

If you launch with the arguments "--file [path]", thislang will attempt to read and execute the file(pathes without spaces for now due to coder issue).

If you launch with the arguments "--code [code]", thislang will execute [code].
